### Main Goal(s) of the project
The main objective of this project is to present interactive image editing tools using a new randomized algorithm for quickly finding approximate nearest neighbor matches between image patches. This one simple algorithm forms the basis for a variety of tools – image retargeting, completion and reshuffling – that can be used together in the context of a high-level image editing application. One more feature is additional intuitive constraints on the synthesis process that offer the user a level of control unavailable in any other methods.
